## Safety Reminders

### Critical Warnings

1. **ALWAYS USE VIRTUAL MACHINES**
   - RAID operations destroy data
   - LVM commands can wipe disks
   - File system operations are destructive
   - Mistakes can crash systems

2. **Take Snapshots**
   - Before each exercise
   - Before major operations
   - Before final project work

3. **Use Loop Devices**
   - Never use real disks for learning
   - Loop devices are safe and reversible
   - Easy to recreate

4. **Verify Commands**
   - Double-check device names
   - Use tab completion
   - Start with dry runs when available

5. **Test in Isolation**
   - Dedicated VM for this course
   - No important data on system
   - Network isolated if possible
