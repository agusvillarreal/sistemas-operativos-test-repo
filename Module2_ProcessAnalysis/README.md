# Module 2: Process Analysis & Monitoring

Complete teaching materials for understanding process states, the /proc filesystem, and monitoring tools.

## üìÅ Contents

- `LECTURE_NOTES.md` - Complete theory and explanations
- `examples/` - Working C code demonstrations
  - `01_process_states.c` - All process states (R, S, D, Z, T)
  - `02_proc_reader.c` - Read /proc filesystem
- `Makefile` - Build all examples

## üéØ Learning Objectives

Students will learn to:
1. Understand all Linux process states
2. Read and parse /proc filesystem
3. Monitor processes with ps, top, htop
4. Identify and handle zombie processes
5. Measure CPU, memory, and I/O usage

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
cd examples/
make
./01_process_states    # See all process states
./02_proc_reader list  # List all processes
```
