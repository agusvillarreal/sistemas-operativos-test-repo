## 💡 Real-World Applications

### Multiple Writers Pattern
- **System Logging**: Multiple services → centralized log daemon
- **Monitoring**: Multiple sensors → data aggregator
- **Event Bus**: Multiple publishers → event processor
- **Print Spooler**: Multiple apps → print queue manager

### Bidirectional Pattern
- **Database Client**: App sends SQL → DB processes → returns results
- **Remote Procedure Call**: Client invokes → server executes → returns value
- **Command Shell**: User sends commands → shell executes → returns output
- **HTTP Server**: Browser requests → server processes → sends response

## 🧪 Suggested Classroom Activities

### Activity 1: Message Race (15 min)
- Have 3 students each use a writer
- Send messages simultaneously
- Observe message ordering
- **Discussion**: Why is order unpredictable?

### Activity 2: Build a Chat System (30 min)
- Challenge: Use multiple writers pattern
- Each student is a "chat client" (writer)
- One "chat server" (reader) displays all messages
- **Extension**: Add timestamps, usernames

### Activity 3: Calculator Service (20 min)
- Use bidirectional pattern
- Client sends: "5 + 3"
- Server calculates and responds: "8"
- **Extension**: Support multiple operations

### Activity 4: Performance Testing (15 min)
- Send 1000 messages from one writer - measure time
- Send 1000 messages from 3 writers - measure time
- **Discussion**: Does concurrent writing improve throughput?

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Message Atomicity
- Messages < `PIPE_BUF` (typically 4096 bytes) are atomic
- Larger messages may interleave
- `PIPE_BUF` is defined in `<limits.h>`

### Blocking Behavior
- `open()` blocks until both ends connected
- `read()` blocks if FIFO empty
- `write()` blocks if FIFO buffer full
- Use `O_NONBLOCK` to change this

### Buffer Size
- Typical FIFO buffer: 64 KB (Linux)
- Check: `/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size`
- Adjust: `fcntl(fd, F_SETPIPE_SZ, size)`

### Error Handling
- **EPIPE**: Write to FIFO with no readers
- **EAGAIN**: Non-blocking I/O would block
- **EINTR**: System call interrupted by signal

## 🐛 Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Opening Order
```c
// WRONG - May deadlock!
fd_write = open(FIFO, O_WRONLY);  // Blocks waiting for reader
fd_read = open(FIFO, O_RDONLY);   // Never reached!
```

**Solution**: Start reader first, or use `O_NONBLOCK`

### Pitfall 2: Forgetting to Close
```c
// WRONG - Reader never gets EOF
write(fd, msg, len);
// Forgot: close(fd);
```

**Solution**: Always close() when done

### Pitfall 3: Large Messages
```c
// RISKY - May interleave with other writers!
char huge[10000];
write(fd, huge, sizeof(huge));
```

**Solution**: Keep messages < PIPE_BUF (4096 bytes)

### Pitfall 4: Cleanup
```c
// WRONG - FIFO persists after program exits!
mkfifo("/tmp/myfifo", 0666);
// Forgot: unlink("/tmp/myfifo");
```

**Solution**: Call `unlink()` or `make clean`

## 📈 Assessment Questions

### Knowledge Check
1. What's the maximum atomic write size for FIFOs?
2. How many FIFOs are needed for bidirectional communication?
3. What happens if you write to a FIFO with no readers?
4. Can multiple processes read from the same FIFO simultaneously?

### Critical Thinking
1. When would you choose FIFOs over sockets?
2. How would you implement a broadcast system (one writer, many readers)?
3. What are the pros/cons of FIFOs vs message queues?
4. How could you add priority to the multiple writers pattern?

### Answers
See `ADVANCED_FIFO_DEMOS.md` for detailed explanations.

- ✅ Process creation (`fork`)
- ✅ What FIFOs/named pipes are
- ✅ Basic IPC concepts

## 📚 Further Reading

### Related IPC Mechanisms
- **Pipes** (`pipe()`) - Unnamed, parent-child only
- **Message Queues** - Structured, persistent messages
- **Shared Memory** - Fastest, requires synchronization
- **Sockets** - Network-capable, most flexible

### Progression Path
1. Start: Anonymous pipes
2. Basic: Named pipes (FIFOs) ← **You are here**
3. Advanced: Message queues, shared memory
4. Network: Unix domain sockets, TCP/IP sockets

### Resources
- `man 7 fifo` - FIFO overview
- `man 2 mkfifo` - Create FIFOs
- `man 2 open` - Open with O_NONBLOCK
- `man 3 mkfifo` - C library function
