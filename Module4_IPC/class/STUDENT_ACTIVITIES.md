```
Parent: Sending "Hello Child"
Child: Received "Hello Child"
Child: Sending "Hello Parent"
Parent: Received "Hello Parent"
```

**Hints**:

## üîí Semaphore Activities

**Files**: `semaphore.c`, `simple_semaphore.c`, `semaphore_demo.c`

### Activity 5.1: Bank Account Synchronization (‚≠ê‚≠ê Intermediate, 40 min)

**Learning Objective**: Prevent race conditions

**Task**: Simulate bank account with concurrent deposits/withdrawals.

**Scenario**:
- Shared variable: `int account_balance = 1000`
- 10 processes each try to deposit $100
- 10 processes each try to withdraw $50
- Expected final balance: 1000 + 1000 - 500 = 1500

**Without Semaphore**: Balance will be WRONG due to race conditions
**With Semaphore**: Balance will be correct (1500)

**Implementation**:
1. Use shared memory for `account_balance`
2. Use semaphore to protect access
3. Each process: acquire lock ‚Üí modify balance ‚Üí release lock

---

### Activity 5.2: Reader-Writer Problem (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Advanced, 60 min)

**Rules**:
- Multiple readers can read at the same time
- Only ONE writer at a time
- No readers while writer is writing
- No writer while readers are reading

**Semaphores Needed**:
```c
sem_mutex       // Protects reader_count
sem_write       // Exclusive access for writing
int reader_count = 0;
```

**Algorithm**:
```
Reader:
  wait(mutex)
  reader_count++
  if (reader_count == 1) wait(write)  // First reader blocks writers
  signal(mutex)
  
  READ DATA
  
  wait(mutex)
  reader_count--
  if (reader_count == 0) signal(write)  // Last reader unblocks writers
  signal(mutex)

Writer:
  wait(write)
  WRITE DATA
  signal(write)
```

**Test**: 5 readers, 2 writers, verify correctness

---

### Activity 5.3: Dining Philosophers (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Expert, 90 min)

**Learning Objective**: Solve complex synchronization problem

**Problem**:
- 5 philosophers sit at round table
- 5 chopsticks (one between each pair)
- Each philosopher: THINK ‚Üí pick up 2 chopsticks ‚Üí EAT ‚Üí put down chopsticks
- Goal: No deadlock, no starvation

**Naive Solution (DEADLOCKS)**:
```c
pick_up(left_chopstick);
pick_up(right_chopstick);
eat();
put_down(right_chopstick);
put_down(left_chopstick);
```
If all pick up left simultaneously ‚Üí DEADLOCK!

**Solutions to Implement**:
1. **Resource Ordering**: Odd philosophers pick left first, even pick right first
2. **Limit Diners**: Allow only 4 philosophers to attempt eating at once
3. **Waiter**: Central coordinator grants permission

**Deliverable**: 
- Working implementation (no deadlock)
- Demonstration with output showing each philosopher's actions
- Analysis of solution chosen

## üí° Tips for Success

### General Tips
1. **Start Simple**: Get basic version working first
2. **Test Incrementally**: Test after each feature
3. **Handle Errors**: Check return values!
4. **Clean Up**: Remove IPC resources when done
5. **Document**: Comment your code

### Debugging IPC
```bash
# Check active IPC resources
ipcs -a

# Remove stuck resources
ipcrm -q <queue_id>
ipcrm -s <semaphore_id>

# Monitor FIFOs
ls -l /tmp/*fifo*

# Check processes
ps aux | grep your_program
```

### Testing Strategies
1. **Unit Test**: Test each component separately
2. **Integration Test**: Test components together
3. **Stress Test**: Many concurrent processes
4. **Error Test**: Intentionally cause errors
5. **Performance Test**: Measure throughput/latency
