## 💡 Tips for Success

### For Instructors:

- Hold weekly progress meetings
- Provide sample VM for testing
- Review architecture in week 1
- Test RAID demos in class
- Share debugging strategies

### For Students:

- Use VM snapshots frequently
- Test with loop devices (not real disks!)

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### Safety First!

🚨 **ALWAYS use a Virtual Machine**
- RAID operations can destroy data
- Kernel modules can crash the system
- LVM commands can wipe disks
- Testing must be on isolated environment

🚨 **Never test on:**
- Your main computer
- Production systems
- Systems with important data
- Shared lab machines

🚨 **Always:**
- Use loop devices for testing
- Take VM snapshots before experiments
- Verify commands before execution
- Have backups
