# Module 3: CPU Scheduling

Complete teaching materials for CPU scheduling algorithms.

## üìÅ Contents

- `LECTURE_NOTES.md` - Complete theory for all scheduling algorithms
- `examples/scheduler_simulator.c` - Working scheduler implementations
- `examples/Makefile` - Build system

## üéØ Learning Objectives

Students will:
1. Understand scheduling metrics (turnaround, response, waiting time)
2. Implement FIFO, SJF, STCF, and Round Robin
3. Analyze algorithm trade-offs
4. Compare performance on different workloads
5. Build GUI scheduler simulator (Homework 3)

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
cd examples/
make
make test  # Run all algorithms on test workload
```
